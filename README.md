# GiveChain

GiveChain is a decentralized donating system, allowing people to donate to various social and enviornmental issues. And the best part, there is no middleman!! So you have no 'trust-issues' to stand between the donor and the charity, which increases confidence and reduces fraud.

# Problem Statement

We intend to solve the trust issues and frauds in such a good cause, **DONATION**. With GiveChain you are sure the money went to the appropriate person.
