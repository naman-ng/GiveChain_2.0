# GiveChain 🦸‍♀️🦸‍♂️

GiveChain is a decentralized donating system, allowing people to donate to various social and enviornmental issues. <br>
The best part, there is no middleman!! So you have no 'trust-issues' to stand between the donor and the charity, which increases confidence and reduces fraud.
<br>

## 🌟Push Protocol Integration🌟

- Opt-In and Opt-Out option for gettting into GiveChain notification channel.
- Broadcast notification to everyone when new campaign is created.
- Group notification to fellow-peer donators when you donate to a campaign -- NEW FREN!!
- Push Chat integration for asking any question from the poster of a campaign.
- Display all notifications of a user in the "bell icon" on the front page.
